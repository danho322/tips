# Tip Calculator Prework for CODEPATH

Sample Swift project used to apply to [CodePath iOS bootcamp](https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_ios/thanks_for_applying).
The goal of this project was to follow a Swift tutorial on creating a tip calculator, and then adding a settings view to keep track of a default user setting. The project is to be submitted as part of an application to the iOS Bootcamp for Engineers in San Francisco.
I had never worked with Swift before, and hope to be a part of this iOS Bootcamp to learn and grow as an iOS developer!
